Except written otherwise, numbers (including ports) are encoded in little endian
Except written otherwise, messages are valid client to server and server to client and on both protocols

Bridges configured are then identified by their index

Message codes (excluding initial port transmission over TCP):

- 0 : No-op

- 1 : Config (configure a bridge, giving information on server-side endpoint)
	Client to server only
	* 2b : message size (proto + dst port + target name with null term)
	* 1b : protocol (0:TCP, 1:UDP)
	* 2b : dst port
	* ?b : target name, null-terminated

- 2 : Message (any proto, the bridge is on the same proto as the message was transmitted)
	* 2b : bridge index
	* 4b : payload size
	* ?b : payload

- 3 : Connect (TCP only, client to server)
	tcp connected to client endpoint, do the same on server endpoint
	* 2b : bridge index

- 4 : UDP Connected (UDP only)

- 5 : TCP Disconnected (TCP Only)
	* 2b : bridge index
